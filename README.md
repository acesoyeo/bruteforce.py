# bruteforce.py
Here is the Python script I used to brute force and extract the password when I see it on the other computer which is back.sh something weird save as mysql file.
On executing the script, we got the password for root.
First you have to create python file script on vim.
$vim python script.py

Execute the file using chmod:
$cdmod +x script.py

Then finally you can run:

$python3 script.py
-it will generate the root password of the user.

Rund this command to get the root user:
$su root
$type the password:*****

-here you can navigate the root system of the user!yay!
